# Copilot Instructions

This project is a web application, that allows users to take png files and returns the text content or a pdf file with selectable text. The application is built in Deno and TypeScript.

## Coding Standards

- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.

## Tone

- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
